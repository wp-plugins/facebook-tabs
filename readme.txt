== Description ==

Facebook is a highly used social networking site that is used by millions of individuals and firms for different purposes. Although many people use it mainly for interacting with their known ones, there are individuals and companies that use it for advertisement and promotion of their products. Whatever is the primary motive, i.e. business or entertainment, the features and functions are availed by every member of this social networking website. There are several Facebook tabs under which different sections of every profile are categorized. This categorization makes it simple for the members to find what they look for. 

Several extensions and plugins are available for the website so that the details and activities can be easily tracked by every user and get the users back again on the website. Facebook Tabs offer three different sections to provide details and updates of the respective functions in Facebook. Needless to say that every member of the social networking site has a friend list and the activities of these friends can be tracked by the member. But, the tabs are quite complicated because everything is managed in the same page.

Our Facebook Tabs has three different display:

*   FB Friends: It shows the faces or the profile pictures of the friends who liked a FB Page. It has an option to “Like” the page and also highlights the exact number of individuals who like the specific page. 

*   FB Streams: Every member of FB avails the function of updating status or uploading pictures and videos. This section deals with the status, image or video update done by your friends. Therefore, you can see your friends’ update in the stream section of the Tab.

*   FB Activity: You provide the domain name or URL of certain things many times. This section accumulates the data about the activities done by the URL on FB. Thus, you can keep a track of recent activities of your friends on FB by using this tab.
